## The intuition that LPCE should be used for the query complex such as having many joins. 
```
Let t_{learn} denote the end-to-end execution when the plan is generated by feeding cardinality values from a learned modelâ€“LPCE-I.
```
```
Let t_{opt} denote the end-to-end execution when the plan is generated by feeding actual cardinality values.  
```

We can observe that the accurate estimations are more important to complex queries, as there is performance gap to reach the optimal one.
